# react-advice-generator-app

This project is based on a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) challenge, which involves building an advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/). I have extended the challenge for myself to practice working with APIs. Besides requesting general advice, I have added the option to search for advice using a keyword. Additionally, I have created a Docker image of the app to practice this as well.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository

```git clone https://github.com/Nella1a/react-advice-generator-app.git

```

2. Install dependencies

```npm run install

```

3. Run application

```npm run start

```

4. Open <http://localhost:3000> on your browser.

## Docker

1. Make sure that you have a reasonably recent version of docker installed and running
1. To simple start the application run in your terminal the following command which will
   run an instance of the image and expose it on port 3000:

```docker container run -p 3000:3000 kanjaallen/react-advice-generator:1.2

```

3. Open <http://localhost:3000> on your browser.

## Technologies

JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Docker
